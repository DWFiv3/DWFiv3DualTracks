Provides a FULL dual track from Sylva to Andrews

**This mode is a work in progress IT IS NOT FINISHED.**

**KEEP LEFT**
- Run your trains on the left track, not the right

**Some signals just don't work**, they have been disabled

# Things to note
- Ela Passanger track only works on the inner track (towards whittier), coming the other way you dont stop
- Wilmot station is the same (whittier bound)
